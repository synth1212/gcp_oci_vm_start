	- Image: Ubuntu LTS (default minimal)
	- Boot disk: default smallest size
	- Network: default VPC; allow SSH if prompted
	- Public IP: ephemeral

7. Cleanup check. Verify no leftover disks, snapshots, or static IPs.


Part B — Oracle Cloud (OCI)
1. Compartment. Use the default or create a dedicated Lab compartment.
2. Create a compute instance. Compute → Instances → Create instance:

	- Image: Ubuntu (or Oracle Linux if Ubuntu is unavailable)
	- Boot volume: default minimal size
	- Networking: attach to your VCN/subnet; assign a public IP if required
	- SSH keys: upload a public key if you plan to connect (optional)
3. Start & verify. Launch → wait for state RUNNING.
4. Stop. Use Stop; verify STOPPED.
5. Terminate. Use Terminate with Delete the boot volume checked.
6. Cleanup check. Confirm no instances, boot volumes, or public IPs remain.
